# Handwritten Character Recognition

The dataset for this project was A-Z Handwritten Alphabets taken from Kaggle and a CNN was built to predict characters that any user draws.

## How to Download and Train a Model
### 1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
### 2. Download and open the notebook.
### 3. Press the run all button.
### 4. Wait for the CNN to train and save a copy of the model created (for quicker access the second time the notebook is run).
### 5. Wait for the canvas to materialize.
### 6. Draw any Character from A-Z and press predict character.
### 7. Inspect output for the CNN's predictions and label probabilities.

## Alternative: How to use model already included in this git repo.
### 1. Download and open the notebook.
### 2. Download the 'modelhandwritingfinal2.keras' file included in the repo. 
### 3. Make sure the notebook and the .keras model are in the same folder.
### 4. Scroll to and run the final cell.
### 5. Wait for the canvas to materialize.
### 6. Draw any Character from A-Z and press predict character.
### 7. Inspect output for the CNN's prediction and label probabilities.
