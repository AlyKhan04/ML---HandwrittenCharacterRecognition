The dataset for this project was A-Z Handwritten Alphabets taken from Kaggle and a CNN was built to predict characters that any user draws.

## How to Use
### 1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
### 2. Download and open the notebook
### 3. Press the run all button
### 4. Wait for the CNN to train and save a copy of the model created (for quicker access the second time the notebook is run)
### 5. Wait for the canvas to materialize
### 6. Draw any Character from A-Z and press predict character
### 7. Inspect output for the CNN's predictions and the label probabilities.
